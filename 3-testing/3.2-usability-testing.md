## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Does the game make you want to play it more? Is it enjoyable to play? Does it relieve stress?        |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are menus easy to navigate? Are the controls intuitive and / or easy to learn?                       |
| 3 - Engaging       | Is the game enjoyable? Do you want to play it more than once? Would you recommend it to a friend?    |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Are there any bugs? Does the game crash easily? Is the FPS good/consistent?                          |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Are the controls intuitive or easy to learn? How difficult is it to understand the goal of the game? |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

## User Feedback

### Effective

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The results from this question were not as positive as I had hoped for, with a majority only somewhat agreeing and most people only being neutral or less. I think this has been caused by the lack of graphical complexity in the game. With textures of the car and other objects only consisting of basic shapes.

#### Question 2

Respondents all found the game enjoyable. This means that it was complex enough and robust.

### Efficient

#### Question 3

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

An overwhelming majority of respondents thought that the menus were very easy to navigate. This means that my game should be able to be played by a wide sector of society, something I set out to achieve in [1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md "mention").

#### Question 4

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

All respondents agreed that the controls were easy or intuitive to learn. This is another accessibility feature that I set out to include in [1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md "mention").

### Engaging

#### Question 5

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

While a few people would not be likely to recommend the game to a friend, a majority of respondents would. This shows that I have created an enjoyable game that people would share.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:
