# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

Find success criteria that relate to function and robustness

| Criterion | Description                                                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | The game should be able to consistently run for long periods of time without crashing. |
| 2         | The game should run at a frame rate of either 30 or 60 FPS.                            |

### Criterion 1

To test criterion 1, I tried to do simulate strange actions that I thought could cause the program to crash. Despite not being actions that a user would have reason to do, the program still managed to hold together without crashing after any test.

Some of the tests included pressing buttons repeatedly and unnecessarily as well as trying to abuse the physics engine that was running the game.

### Criterion 2

To test criterion 2, I took the game past the limits of what a player would normally play. As well as increasing the amount of checkpoints and terrain generated, I opened multiple tabs of the game.

Doing these tests likely decreased the FPS of the game significantly.However, it was still able to run smoothly at an FPS consistently above 60 and never below 30.
