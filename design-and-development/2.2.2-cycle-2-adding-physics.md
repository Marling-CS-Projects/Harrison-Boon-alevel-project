# 2.2.2 Cycle 2 - Adding physics

## Overview

In this cycle, I will use a library called `cannon-es` to add physics simulation to the game. I will integrate the physics simulation into my game using ThreeJS to render the position of the cannon-es objects in the scene.

In order to test the physics simulation, I will generate a sloped plane and a ball. I will then add gravity to the simulation so that the ball rolls down the plane. I will also include features developed in the last cycle such as the lighting and the 3D rendering using ThreeJS
