# 2.2.4 Cycle 4 - Template

## Overview

In this cycle, I aim to fix issues that became prevalant in the last cycle, such as issues with the lighting and low-performance algorithms.

The lighting/shadow issues should be relatively easy to fix after researching more about how ThreeJS calculates its shadows and some common issues that people experience. Due to how I currently convert terrain from ThreeJS terrain into CannonES terrain, I think that there is some room to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Currently, the conversion algorithm lists through each point on the plane two different times. This results in a time efficiency of O(2n) where n is the number of points generated \[The efficiency is actually O(2nÂ²) if n is taken to be the length of the map].

### Objectives

* [ ] Fix the shadow bug caused by the last cycle
* [ ] Make the terrain conversion algorithm more performant
* [ ] Adjust terrain generation parameters to represent real-life more accurately
