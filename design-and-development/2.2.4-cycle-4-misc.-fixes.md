# 2.2.4 Cycle 4 - Misc. fixes

## Overview

In this cycle, I aim to fix issues that became prevalent in the last cycle, such as issues with the lighting and low-performance algorithms.

The lighting/shadow issues should be relatively easy to fix after researching more about how ThreeJS calculates its shadows and some common issues that people experience. Due to how I currently convert terrain from ThreeJS terrain into CannonES terrain, I think that there is some room to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Currently, the conversion algorithm lists through each point on the plane two different times. This results in a time efficiency of O(2n) where n is the number of points generated \[The efficiency is actually O(2nÂ²) if n is taken to be the length of the map].

### Objectives

* [x] Fix the shadow bug caused in the last cycle
* [x] Make the terrain conversion algorithm more performant
* [ ] Adjust terrain generation parameters to represent real-life more accurately

## Development

### Outcome

After researching more about ThreeJS's shadow system, it was fairly easy to see where I had gone wrong in the previous cycle. ThreeJS 'directional' lights, and their subsequent shadows, are projected using orthogonal cameras and for performance reasons these are limited in size and range. The default size for the light's shadow camera is relatively small for what I was building so the sphere would often roll out of the range of the camera. So to fix the issue I simply extended each side of the orthogonal camera to reach the edges of the generated terrain - If I had made it any larger than it had to be then the performance could suffer. Due to the increase in size of the camera, the resolution of the shadow decreased, so I also decided to increase the shadow's map size.

```typescript
const directionalLighting = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff);
directionalLighting.position.set(400, 800, 600);
directionalLighting.castShadow = true;
directionalLighting.shadow.camera.top = 250;
directionalLighting.shadow.camera.bottom = -250;
directionalLighting.shadow.camera.left = -250;
directionalLighting.shadow.camera.right = 250;
directionalLighting.shadow.camera.far = 3000;
directionalLighting.shadow.mapSize = new THREE.Vector2(16384, 16384);
```

Optimising the terrain generation went smoothly and after having written out the pseudocode for what I wanted the algorithm to end up like, it was relatively easy to convert that into TypeScript and integrate it into my simulation without encountering any issues. To test that I had actually improved the algorithm, I compared the old code and the new code by making them both generate large terrain maps and seeing how the time increased with each algorithm. The new algorithm seemed to cope better as the size of the terrain increased, meaning that I had improved the time complexity of terrain generation.

```typescript
export function terrainGenerate(seed: string) {
  const simplex = new SimplexNoise(Math.random());
  const colours: number[] = [];
  const segments = 51;
  const planeGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(
    500,
    500,
    segments - 1,
    segments - 1
  );
  const scale = 64;
  const groundMaterial = new CANNON.Material("groundMaterial");

  const trimeshBody = new CANNON.Body({ mass: 0, material: groundMaterial });
  for (let i = 0; i < planeGeometry.attributes.position.count; i++) {
    const x = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[i * 3];
    const y = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[i * 3 + 1];

    const z = simplex.noise2D(x / scale, y / scale) * 20;
    planeGeometry.attributes.position.setZ(i, z);

    if (z > 18) {
      colours.push(1, 1, 1);
    } else if (z > 5) {
      colours.push(0.56, 0.54, 0.48);
    } else if (z < -15) {
      colours.push(0.501, 0.772, 0.87);
    } else {
      colours.push(0.56, 0.68, 0.166);
    }

    if (i % segments == segments - 1) {
      continue;
    }
    const nextX1 = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[(i + 1) * 3];
    const nextY1 = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[(i + 1) * 3 + 1];
    const nextZ1 = simplex.noise2D(nextX1 / scale, nextY1 / scale) * 20;

    const nextX2 = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[(i + segments) * 3];
    const nextY2 =
      planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[(i + segments) * 3 + 1];
    const nextZ2 = simplex.noise2D(nextX2 / scale, nextY2 / scale) * 20;

    const nextX3 =
      planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[(i + 1 + segments) * 3];
    const nextY3 =
      planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[(i + 1 + segments) * 3 + 1];
    const nextZ3 = simplex.noise2D(nextX3 / scale, nextY3 / scale) * 20;

    const vertices1 = [x, y, z, nextX1, nextY1, nextZ1, nextX2, nextY2, nextZ2];
    const indices = [0, 1, 2];
    const trimesh1 = new CANNON.Trimesh(vertices1, indices);
    trimeshBody.addShape(trimesh1);

    const vertices2 = [
      nextX1,
      nextY1,
      nextZ1,
      nextX2,
      nextY2,
      nextZ2,
      nextX3,
      nextY3,
      nextZ3,
    ];
    const trimesh2 = new CANNON.Trimesh(vertices2, indices);
    trimeshBody.addShape(trimesh2);
  }
  trimeshBody.quaternion.setFromAxisAngle(
    new CANNON.Vec3(1, 0, 0),
    -Math.PI / 2
  );
  return { trimeshBody, planeGeometry, colours, groundMaterial };
}
