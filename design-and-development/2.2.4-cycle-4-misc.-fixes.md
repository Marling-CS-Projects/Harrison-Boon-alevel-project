# 2.2.4 Cycle 4 - Misc. fixes

## Overview

In this cycle, I aim to fix issues that became prevalent in the last cycle, such as issues with the lighting and low-performance algorithms.

The lighting/shadow issues should be relatively easy to fix after researching more about how ThreeJS calculates its shadows and some common issues that people experience. Due to how I currently convert terrain from ThreeJS terrain into CannonES terrain, I think that there is some room to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Currently, the conversion algorithm lists through each point on the plane two different times. This results in a time efficiency of O(2n) where n is the number of points generated \[The efficiency is actually O(2nÂ²) if n is taken to be the length of the map].

### Objectives

* [ ] Fix the shadow bug caused by the last cycle
* [ ] Make the terrain conversion algorithm more performant
* [ ] Adjust terrain generation parameters to represent real-life more accurately

### Key Variables

| Variable Name           | Use                                                                                                                             |   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| directionalLight        | Stores information about the directional lighting in the ThreeJS scene.                                                         |   |
| directionalLight.shadow | Stores information about the shadow of the directional light. This includes the orthogonal camera on which the shadow is based. |   |

### Pseudocode

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Lighting" %}
```
directionalLight := createDirectionalLight(directionalLightSettings)
// I then need to adjust the shadow's camera
// Camera is orthogonal therefore I need to adjust the sides of the frustrum
directionalLight.shadow.camera.top = 250
directionalLight.shadow.camera.bottom = -250
directionalLight.shadow.camera.left = -250
directionalLight.shadow.camera.right = 250
directionalLight.shadow.mapSize = 16384 // This prevents the shadow from appearing pixelated
```
