# 2.2.3 Cycle 3 - Terrain generation

## Overview

Now that I am able to render and simulate a sphere in 3D, I now need somewhere to put it. In the main world, I plan to have terrain that would be generated using procedural generation. This is a method whereby computers and computational algorithms are used to generate data randomly.

The data will then be used as a heightmap to create the both the rendered and the simulated ground surface. I will use a noise map for the terrain height because it tends to produce smooth, realistic curves that are neither too steep to drive up nor too bland or boring.

The data for my heightmap will be more specifically produced using a '2D Simplex Noise Map' which can be easily generated using packages in TypeScript. This type of procedural generation needs a 'seed' string for the generation to be based upon. This will be a randomly generated string that, when multiplayer functionality is added, can also be used as an invite code for lobbies.

I will also add colouring to the terrain based off of how high each point on the map is. This will help the level to look more realistic and will also ease the strain on the player's eyes as there will be texture available to make the terrain more visible.

### Objectives

* [x] Generate a heightmap using a simplex noise map
* [x] Generate a ThreeJS plane using the heightmap
* [x] Use the heightmap to generate a Cannon-ES ground object with the same shape as the plane
* [x] Terrain should look neither boring nor too unrealistic
* [ ] Make sure that the new features do not clash with old features
* [x] Graphics should remain low-poly
* [x] Terrain should be coloured based off of height
* [x] Collisions with the ground should be realistic and predicatable

### Key Variables

| Variable Name          | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                 |   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| generateTerrain        | The function being defined that will be used to generate terrain, it will return both a ThreeJS and a CannonES object, both representing the ground.                                                |   |
| simplexMap             | Stores information about the simplex noise map that has been generated. This variable will also be what is used to access height value at certain points of the generated height map.               |   |
| planeGeometry          | This object will contain information about the ThreeJS rendered plane. This information includes vertices.                                                                                          |   |
| planeGeometry.vertices | An array containing information about all of the rendered ThreeJS vertices of the ground plane. This will be used to manipulate how the plane behaves.                                              |   |
| trimesh                | An object containing information about the CannonES simulated physics body. It will be contructed multiple trimesh shapes that are formed by copying information from the ThreeJS plane's vertices. |   |

### Pseudocode

```
Function generateTerrain(seed):
    simplexMap := new SimplexNoiseMap(seed)
    planeGeometry := new PlaneGeometry(50, 50) // Creates a plane with 50 height segments and 50 width segments
    For i = 0  to planeGeometry.vertices.length:
        // Access the height map's value at the vertex's position
        x := planeGeometry.vertices[i].x
        y := planeGeometry.vertices[i].y
        height := simplexMap(x, y)
        
        //  Set the vertex's height accordingly
        planeGeometry.vertices[i].z = height
        
        // Assign each vertex a colour (ThreeJS can handle how each vertex's colour blends with each other)
        If height > 18:
            planeGeometry.vertices[i].colour = highColour
        Else If height > 5:
            planeGeometry.vertices[i].colour = highMidColour
        Else If height > -15:
            planeGeometry.vertices[i].colour = lowMidColour
        Else:
            planeGeometry.vertices[i].colour = lowColour
        End If
    End For
    
    groundMaterial := new CannonGroundMaterial()
    groundBody := CannonBody({
        mass: 0,
        material: groundMaterial,
    })
    
    For i = 0 to planeGeometry.vertices.length:
        // Find current vertex's position
        x := planeGeometry.vertices[i].x
        y := planeGeometry.vertices[i].y
        z := planeGeometry.vertices[i].z
        
        // Find first adjacent vertex's position
        nextX1 := planeGeometry.vertices[i + 1].x
        nextY1 := planeGeometry.vertices[i + 1].y
        nextZ1 := planeGeometry.vertices[i + 1].z
        
        // Find second adjacent vertex's position
        distanceInArray := planeGeometry.size / planeGeometry.segments
        nextX2 := planeGeometry.vertices[i + distanceInArray].x
        nextY2 := planeGeometry.vertices[i + distanceInArray].y
        nextZ2 := planeGeometry.vertices[i + distanceInArray].z
        
        // Find the first and second adjacent vertices' adjacent vertex's position
        nextX3 := planeGeometry.vertices[i + distanceInArray + 1].x
        nextY3 := planeGeometry.vertices[i + distanceInArray + 1].y
        nextZ3 := planeGeometry.vertices[i + distanceInArray + 1].z
        
        // Create a simulated triangle with the same shape as 3 of the ground vertices
        vertices1 := [
            [x, y, z],
            [nextX1, nextY1, nextZ1],
            [nextX2, nextY2, nextZ2]
        ]
        trimesh1 := new Trimesh(vertices1)
        groundBody.addShape(trimesh1)
        
        // Create a second simualted triangle
        vertices2 := [
            [nextX1, nextY1, nextZ1],
            [nextX2, nextY2, nextZ2],
            [nextX3, nexty3, nextZ3]
        ]

    End For
    
    // return both the generated terrain and the simulated ground body
    return (planeGeometry, groundBody)
End Function
```

## Development

### Outcome

By the end of development for this cycle, I had written a function that could generate both a CannonES and ThreeJS plane where the height of various points on the plane would be based off of a simplex noise map function.

This is achieved in the code below by first generating the noise map using a seed that is passed into the function as a parameter. Afterwards, a basic ThreeJS plane geometry is created that will be the base for the eventual terrain. A for loop then iterates through each vertex on the plane and sets its height to the height of the noise map at the same coordinates. The division by 64 on line 11 represents a stretching of the noise map by 64x in both the x and the y direction which helps to produce smoother height changes in the z axis (axis being recorded for height). On the same iteration, each point is then assigned a colour in an array based on how high the point is.

After the first loop, a CannonES body is then created with a mass of 0 (static object) and with the ground material. Another for loop then iterates through each point of the new plane geometry and, for each iteration, creates two trimesh (triangular mesh) shapes that each get added to the CannonES body. One mesh is between the current point and the two points adjacent to it in the positive x and positive y directions. The second mesh is between the same two adjacent points and their commonly adjacent point. After repeating this for all of the points, a replica of the plane geometry is represented by the multiple trimesh shapes that make up the CannonES body. The first line of this loop (Line 32) makes sure that the points that are on the edge of the plane do not try to access points that are non-existant.

```typescript
function generateTerrain(seed) {
  const simplex = new SimplexNoise(seed);
  const planeGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(500, 500, 50, 50);
  const groundMaterial = new CANNON.Material("ground");
 
  const colours: number[] = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < planeGeometry.attributes.position.count; i++) {
    const x = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[i * 3];
    const y = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[i * 3 + 1];
  
    const height = simplex.noise2D(x / 64, y / 64) * 20;
    planeGeometry.attributes.position.setZ(i, height);
  
    if (height > 18) {
      colours.push(1, 1, 1);
    } else if (height > 5) {
      colours.push(0.56, 0.54, 0.48);
    } else if (height < -15) {
      colours.push(0.501, 0.772, 0.87);
    } else {
      colours.push(0.56, 0.68, 0.166);
    }
  }
  
  const trimeshBody = new CANNON.Body({
    mass: 0,
    material: groundMaterial,
  });
  
  // This loops through the vertices of the rendered plane and sets the heights of the simulated plane to the heights of the rendered plane
  for (let i = 0; i < planeGeometry.attributes.position.count; i++) {
    if (i % segments == segments - 1) {
      continue;
    }
    const x = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[i * 3];
    const y = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[i * 3 + 1];
    const z = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[i * 3 + 2];
  
    const tx = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[(i + 1) * 3];
    const ty = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[(i + 1) * 3 + 1];
    const tz = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[(i + 1) * 3 + 2];
  
    const dx = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[(i + 1 + segments) * 3];
    const dy =
      planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[(i + 1 + segments) * 3 + 1];
    const dz =
      planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[(i + 1 + segments) * 3 + 2];
  
    const ex = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[(i + segments) * 3];
    const ey = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[(i + segments) * 3 + 1];
    const ez = planeGeometry.attributes.position.array[(i + segments) * 3 + 2];
  
    const vertices1 = [x, y, z, tx, ty, tz, ex, ey, ez];
    const indices = [0, 1, 2];
    const trimesh1 = new CANNON.Trimesh(vertices1, indices);
    trimeshBody.addShape(trimesh1);
  
    const vertices2 = [tx, ty, tz, ex, ey, ez, dx, dy, dz];
    const trimesh2 = new CANNON.Trimesh(vertices2, indices);
    trimeshBody.addShape(trimesh2);
  }
  trimeshBody.quaternion.setFromAxisAngle(new CANNON.Vec3(1, 0, 0), -Math.PI / 2);
  return [planeGeometry, trimeshBody];
}
```

### Challenges

This current cycle has encountered many challenges. One of the problems that arose from this cycle's development was that the index file (`/src/index.ts`) of my project - where all of the code was being written to - was getting too large for me to manage. If I needed to find a block of code I had to scroll through unnecessarily large sections of code in order to reach it. I decided to solve this issue before the code got any bigger. This meant that I would write the new terrain generation function in a separate file from which the function can be imported and then used.

Another issue I found while developing for this cycle is that, despite CannonES being designed to be as compatible with ThreeJS as possible, CannonES and ThreeJS use different systems for managing complex structures such as the terrain that I plan to generate. For ThreeJS it is relatively simple to create the desired shape. All that is needed is to create a regular plane object and modify each vertex's height to the target height of the generated height map. For CannonES it is far more complex to generate a physics body that can replicate the height map. The solution I have come up with is to create a physics body with multiple trimesh (triangular) shapes, each of which will match up to points on the ThreeJS rendered plane. I may need to re-evalute this solution in the future as it could turn out to be significantly detrimental for the performance of the game.

One issue that I left unsolved is related to how ThreeJS manages its shadow simulation - especially when using directional lighting like I am. ThreeJS uses an orthogonal camera to manage its directional light shadows. Unlike other lights in ThreeJS, the directional light uses an orthogonal camera for its shadows. This is because light rays produced from directional lights are parallel to each other. The problem with my lighting's shadow in particular is that the area that the shadows camera covers is not the same size as the map that I'm generating. This then means that shadows are not being rendered for the entirety of the map and can act strangely. A similar issue to do with shadows that was easier to fix and that I did end up fixing was that, on occassion, the light source would end up being placed under/in the terrain. This meant that the shadows for the terrain were not acting like they were supposed to.

Due to the fact that CannonES objects are not rendered themselves means that attempting to debug the generation of terrain was exceedingly difficult. If the trimesh shapes were generating incorrectly I would have no way of knowing what the shapes without having to study the movements of the simualted ball that is dropped onto the shapes. This issue ended up holding up the cycle's development as it turned out that there was an issue with the trimesh shapes being generated that was difficult to debug because of the lack of rendering.&#x20;
