# 2.2.3 Cycle 3 - Terrain generation

Now that I am able to render and simulate a sphere in 3D, I now need somewhere to put it. In the main world, I plan to have terrain that would be generated using procedural generation. This is a method whereby computers and computational algorithms are used to generate data randomly.

The data will then be used as a heightmap to create the both the rendered and the simulated ground surface. I will use this method for the terrain height because it tends to produce smooth, realistic curves that are neither too steep to drive up nor too bland or boring.

The data for my heightmap will be more specifically produced using a '2D Noise Map' which can be easily generated using packages in TypeScript.
