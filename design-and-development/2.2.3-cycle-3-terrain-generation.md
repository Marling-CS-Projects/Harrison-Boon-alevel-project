# 2.2.3 Cycle 3 - Terrain generation

## Overview

Now that I am able to render and simulate a sphere in 3D, I now need somewhere to put it. In the main world, I plan to have terrain that would be generated using procedural generation. This is a method whereby computers and computational algorithms are used to generate data randomly.

The data will then be used as a heightmap to create the both the rendered and the simulated ground surface. I will use a noise map for the terrain height because it tends to produce smooth, realistic curves that are neither too steep to drive up nor too bland or boring.

The data for my heightmap will be more specifically produced using a '2D Simplex Noise Map' which can be easily generated using packages in TypeScript. This type of procedural generation needs a 'seed' string for the generation to be based upon. This will be a randomly generated string that, when multiplayer functionality is added, can also be used as an invite code for lobbies.

### Objectives

* [x] Generate a heightmap using a Simplex noise map
* [x] Generate a ThreeJS plane using the heightmap
* [x] Use the heightmap to generate a Cannon-ES ground object with the same shape as the plane
* [x] Terrain should look neither boring nor too unrealistic
* [ ] Make sure that the new features do not clash with old features
* [x] Graphics should remain low-poly
* [x] Collisions with the ground should be realistic and predicatable
