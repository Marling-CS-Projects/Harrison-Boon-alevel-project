# 2.2.8 Cycle 8 - Adding a finish to the game

## Overview

Currently the checkpoints, when run over, just disappear. I now need to make it so that when all of the checkpoints have been reached, the game ends and displays a final score based on the time it took the player to reach all the checkpoints.

### Objectives

* [x] Player should be able to get all points
* [x] Once all checkpoints have been reached, gameplay should stop
* [x] A menu displaying a score should open once the gameplay has stopped
* [x] The simulation should also stop to prevent a memory leak

### Key Variables

| Variable Name       | Use                                                                                                               |   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| points              | An array containing all of the active points                                                                      |   |
| endGame             | A function triggered at the end of the game                                                                       |   |
| continue            | This continues the simulation and the animation                                                                   |   |
| showEndScreen(time) | This will show the end screen and passes through the parameter `time` which is how long it took the player to win |   |

### Pseudocode

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Detecting end of game" %}
```
...
If points.length == 0:
    endGame()
Else:
    continue()
End If
...
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Detecting Collisions" %}
```
Function endGame():
    showEndScreen(time)
End Function
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Development

### Outcome

There wasn't much work to be done for this cycle but it was relatively annoying for me as I kept making silly mistakes with my code which would lead to me having to spend time fixing bugs.

In the `/src/startGame.ts` file, I added some logic that would run the game ending function when all of the points had disappeared. If there were still points left, it would run the simulation. Having it work this way means that the game stops simulating upon completion which is useful for preventing memory leaks that could cause the program to crash.

The argument in the function call `endGame(Date.now() - epochTime)` is the calculated time between when the game started `epochTime` and when the game is finished `Date.now()`.

The `/src/endGame.ts` file is used for displaying the menu. Upon loading the game initially there is a div in `/src/index.html` which is hidden. When the `endGame` function is triggered, the hidden div is then shown and its html is filled with the time value that the player achieved.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="/src/startGame.ts" %}
```typescript
...
const epochTime = Date.now()
...
  if (points.length == 0) {
      endGame(Date.now() - epochTime);
    } else {
      window.requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    }
...
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="/src/endGame.ts" %}
```typescript
export function endGame(endTime: number) {
  document.getElementById("finish-screen")?.classList.remove("hide");
  document.getElementById(
    "finish-screen"
  )!.innerHTML = `<p>A winner is you,\n you won in </p><h1>${endTime}ms</h1>`;
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Challenges

The main challenge was trying to work out how to measure the time taken for the player to win. I considered adding an external library based around timers, but thought it would be much less complex to just store a date object at the start of the game and then compare it to the time at the end of the game. This would also be using built-in packages which are more universal.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                       | What I expect                                 | What actually happens |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1    | Load the game and start playing    | The menu and game should load as normal       | As expected           |
| 2    | Drive over each of the checkpoints | They should disappear as they are run over    | As expected           |
| 3    | Drive over the last checkpoint     | Finish game screen should show                | As expected           |
| 4    | -                                  | Simulation should stop                        | As expected           |
| 5    | -                                  | Time on finish game screen should be accurate | As expected           |
| 6    | -                                  | Make sure nothing broke after updating        | As expected           |
