# 2.2.8 Cycle 8 - Adding a finish to the game

## Overview

Currently the checkpoints, when run over, just disappear. I now need to make it so that when all of the checkpoints have been reached, the game ends and displays a final score based on the time it took the player to reach all the checkpoints.

### Objectives

* [x] Player should be able to get all points
* [x] Once all checkpoints have been reached, gameplay should stop
* [x] A menu displaying a score should open once the gameplay has stopped
* [x] The simulation should also stop to prevent a memory leak

### Key Variables

| Variable Name       | Use                                                                                                               |   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| points              | An array containing all of the active points                                                                      |   |
| endGame             | A function triggered at the end of the game                                                                       |   |
| continue            | This continues the simulation and the animation                                                                   |   |
| showEndScreen(time) | This will show the end screen and passes through the parameter `time` which is how long it took the player to win |   |

### Pseudocode

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Detecting end of game" %}
```
...
If points.length == 0:
    endGame()
Else:
    continue()
End If
...
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Detecting Collisions" %}
```
Function endGame():
    showEndScreen(time)
End Function
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Development

### Outcome

There wasn't much work to be done for this cycle but it was relatively annoying for me as I kept making silly mistakes with my code which would lead to me having to spend time fixing bugs.

In the `/src/startGame.ts` file, I added some logic that would run the game ending function when all of the points had disappeared. If there were still points left, it would run the simulation. Having it work this way means that the game stops simulating upon completion which is useful for preventing memory leaks that could cause the program to crash.

The argument in the function call `endGame(Date.now() - epochTime)` is the calculated time between when the game started `epochTime` and when the game is finished `Date.now()`.

The `/src/endGame.ts` file is used for displaying the menu. Upon loading the game initially there is a div in `/src/index.html` which is hidden. When the `endGame` function is triggered, the hidden div is then shown and its html is filled with the time value that the player achieved.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="/src/startGame.ts" %}
```typescript
...
const epochTime = Date.now()
...
  if (points.length == 0) {
      endGame(Date.now() - epochTime);
    } else {
      window.requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    }
...
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="/src/endGame.ts" %}
```typescript
export function endGame(endTime: number) {
  document.getElementById("finish-screen")?.classList.remove("hide");
  document.getElementById(
    "finish-screen"
  )!.innerHTML = `<p>A winner is you,\n you won in </p><h1>${endTime}ms</h1>`;
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Challenges

The collision detection algorithm isn't entirely accurate and can sometimes trigger before or after the sphere and the vehicle intersect. This is because the x, y and z offsets in `detectCollision`'s If statement are not taking into account the vehicle's rotation and are instead instating a static collision bounding box around the car. Calculating the collisions further for a more accurate and realistic collision would decrease the performance of the program as well as increasing the complexity from a development standpoint. Besides, with the current algorithm, the slight discrepancies aren't too noticeable.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions               | What I expect                                         | What actually happens |
| ---- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1    | Load the game              | The menu should load                                  | As expected           |
| 2    | Press Start                | The game should load as normal                        | As expected           |
| 3    | -                          | Map should have checkpoints displayed                 | As expected           |
| 4    | Repeat 1-3 a few times     | Checkpoints should appear to have random distribution | As expected           |
| 5    | Drive over the checkpoints | Checkpoints should disappear                          | As expected           |
| 6    | -                          | Make sure nothing broke after updating                | As expected           |
