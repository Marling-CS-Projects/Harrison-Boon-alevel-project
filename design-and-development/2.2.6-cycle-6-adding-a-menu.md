# 2.2.6 Cycle 6 - Adding a menu & GUI

## Overview

So far the game just launches and starts up when you open the tab in a browser. In order to make it feel a bit more like a game, I plan to add a main menu that will open before the game starts. From here the user should be able to access the settings and also be able to select different modes if I add those later.

### Objectives

* [x] Make the game launch into a menu
* [x] Add a controls button
* [ ] The background of the menu is a preview of the game's terrain
* [x] Add a loading screen while the terrain loads in

### Key Variables

| Variable Name           | Use                                                       |   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| \<div id=menu>          | This is just a flexbox div used for centering the buttons |   |
| \<button id="start">    | This button starts the game and loads up the map          |   |
| \<button id="settings"> | This button loads the settings menu                       |   |
| document.getElementById | Retrieves an HTML element based by its id                 |   |

### Pseudocode

```
startButton.onClick = {
    startGame()
}
settingsButton.onClick = {
    settingsMenu.show()
}
keyDownListener.addEvent({
    If key == "Escape":
        settingsMenu.hide()
})
```

## Development

### Outcome

First, to make sure that the main "index.ts" file was kept tidy and had a single purpose, I move all of the game logic to a separate file in "/src/startGame.ts". I contained it inside of a function so that it could be called when I wanted from the index file. I won't immediately run this function when the game loads, it will only be triggered when the button is pressed.

I then added a menu \<div> tag to the HTML file that contained two buttons (the start and the settings button). In order to detect the button presses, I added an even listener to the document (code in index.ts). The event listener for the start button runs the startGame function that contains the code I just moved out into a separate file. Whereas the event listener for the settings button removes the "hide" class from the controls module thereby making it able to be viewed and interacted with.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="/src/index.ts" %}
```typescript
import { startGame } from "./startGame";

document.getElementById("start")?.addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.getElementById("start")!.innerHTML = "Loading...";
  document.getElementById("start")!.classList.add("small");
  setTimeout(() => startGame(), 1);
});

document.getElementById("controls")?.addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.getElementById("controls-menu")?.classList.remove("hide");
});
document.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
  if (e.key == "Escape") {
    document.getElementById("controls-menu")?.classList.add("hide");
  }
});
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="/public/index.html" %}
```html
<div class="menu" id="menu">
  <button id="start">
    <p>Start</p>
  </button>
  <button id="controls">
    <p>Controls</p>
  </button>
</div>
<div class="controls menu hide" id="controls-menu">
  <h1><u>Controls:</u></h1>
  <span>
    <p>Accelerator</p>
    <p>W</p>
  </span>
  <span>
    <p>Brakes</p>
    <p>S</p>
  </span>
  <span>
    <p>Steer left</p>
    <p>A</p>
  </span>
  <span>
    <p>Steer right</p>
    <p>D</p>
  </span>
  <span>
    <p>Orbit camera</p>
    <p>Left mouse</p>
  </span>
  <span>
    <p>Pan camera</p>
    <p>Right click</p>
  </span>
  <span>
    <p>Close menu</p>
    <p>Esc</p>
  </span>
</div>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Challenges

I wasn't able to have the background be a preview of the terrain purely just because it would have to load the terrain twice, once before the menu even showed up. This would cause a big delay at the start of the game and I decided that it just wouldn't be worth it to do that.&#x20;

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                            | What I expect                                   | What actually happens |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1    | Load the game                           | The menu should load instead of the game        | As expected           |
| 2    | Click on "controls" then close the menu | Controls menu should launch and close correctly | As expected           |
| 3    | Click the start button                  | Game should launch as usual                     | As expected           |
| 4    | Play the game                           | Ensure nothing has broken/changed               | As expected           |
