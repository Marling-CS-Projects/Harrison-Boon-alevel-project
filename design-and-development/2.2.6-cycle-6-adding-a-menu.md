# 2.2.6 Cycle 6 - Adding a menu

## Overview

So far the game just launches and starts up when you open the tab in a browser. In order to make it feel a bit more like a game, I plan to add a main menu that will open before the game starts. From here the user should be able to access the settings and also be able to select different modes if I add those later.

### Objectives

* [ ] Make the game launch into a menu
* [ ] Add a settings button
* [ ] The background of the menu is a preview of the game's terrain
*

### Key Variables

| Variable Name           | Use                                                              |   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| vehicleChassisBody      | Cannon-ES object for the physics object of the vehicle's chassis |   |
| vehicleChassisMesh      | Three-JS object for the appearance of the vehicle's chassis      |   |
| vehicle                 | Cannon-ES object for the vehicle (chassis + wheels)              |   |
| wheelBody1 - wheelBody4 | Cannon-ES objects for physics objects of the vehicle's wheels    |   |
| wheelMesh1 - wheelMesh4 | Three-JS object for the appearance of the vehicle's wheels       |   |

### Pseudocode

```
Function generateVehicle():
    vehicleChassisBody := new CannonBody()
    vehicleChassisBody.addShape(new CannonBox(dimensions))
    vehicleChassisMesh := new ThreeBoxMesh()
    
    vehicle := new CannonVehicle({chassis: vehicleChassisBody})
    
    wheelBody1 := new CannonBody()
    wheelBody1.addShape(new CannonSphere(dimensions))
    wheelMesh1 := new ThreeSphereMesh()
    # (repeated for all 4 wheels)
    vehicle.addWheels(wheelBody1, wheelBody2, wheelBody3, wheelBody4)
    return (vehicleChassisBody, vehicleChassisMesh, vehicle, wheelBodies, wheelMeshes)
End Function
```

## Development

### Outcome

Thankfully, Cannon-ES's rigid vehicle class is easy to implement and can be created in a relatively small amount of code. Implementing controls for the vehicle, however, was a bit more obfuscated due to the docs for Cannon-ES not explaining engine/motor/steering controls as well as I would have liked. This made it difficult for me to work out the right functions to use when the player presses a movement button.

Eventually, I settled upon what I thought were the right functions to simulate the behaviour of using the accelerator / brake pedals. There's currently no way to make the car go backwards because of how the controls are designed so I plan to add a "reverse gear" in a later cycle.

### Challenges

The main challenges I faced were related to understanding the CannonES docs and what functions I should use to simulate control of the accelerator and brake pedals. After testing a variety of functions related to movement of the wheels, I settled on the two that I would use.

To generate the terrain, I am currently using CannonES Trimeshes, these work well for collisions with spheres, however CannonES does not support collisions between Trimeshes and other shapes of bodies. This means that the wheels on my car, while appearing like cylinders, will actually be simulated spheres. Similarly, the chassis of my car is a box so it won't be able to collide with the ground terrain. While it was irritating, this issue didn't particularly slow down the development process as the workaround was simple to implement.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                    | What I expect                                                     | What actually happens |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1    | Load the game                   | The game should load without crashing                             | As expected           |
| 2    | Watch the simulation            | There should be a vehicle as well as the ball                     | As expected           |
| 3    | Test the accelerator and brakes | Car should accelerate at reasonable pace and stop appropriately   | As expected           |
| 4    | Test the steering               | Car's front wheels should turn, causing the whole chassis to turn | As expected           |
| 5    | Drive around                    | Collision with terrain shouldn't be too springy / unrealistic     | As expected           |
