# 2.2.5 Cycle 5 - Adding a vehicle

## Overview

This cycle is the first of many that will focus on fleshing the game out and adding some of the core game components. Mainly, this one will be focusing on adding a vehicle that a player will be able to control and move around the map. I decided to start with this component because it would be what I base all of the other components on.
