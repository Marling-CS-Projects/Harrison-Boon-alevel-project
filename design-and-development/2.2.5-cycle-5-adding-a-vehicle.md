# 2.2.5 Cycle 5 - Adding a vehicle

## Overview

This cycle is the first of many that will focus on fleshing the game out and adding some of the core game components. Mainly, this one will be focusing on adding a vehicle that a player will be able to control and move around the map. I decided to start with this component because it would be what I base all of the other components on.

### Objectives

* [x] Add a vehicle to the map
* [x] Allow the user to control the vehicle's movement
* [x] Make sure the vehicle interacts with the terrain somewhat realistic
* [x] Finally adjust terrain parameters to fit the car

### Key Variables

| Variable Name           | Use                                                              |   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| vehicleChassisBody      | Cannon-ES object for the physics object of the vehicle's chassis |   |
| vehicleChassisMesh      | Three-JS object for the appearance of the vehicle's chassis      |   |
| vehicle                 | Cannon-ES object for the vehicle (chassis + wheels)              |   |
| wheelBody1 - wheelBody4 | Cannon-ES objects for physics objects of the vehicle's wheels    |   |
| wheelMesh1 - wheelMesh4 | Three-JS object for the appearance of the vehicle's wheels       |   |
