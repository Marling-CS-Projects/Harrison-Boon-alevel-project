# 2.2.1 Cycle 1 - Getting Started

## Overview

In this first cycle I aim to create a TypeScript project using Snowpack that can be used to render objects on the screen using ThreeJS. I will also set up basic collision detection and collision handling using cannon-es, a lightweight physics engine built for the web.

While most of the code written in this cycle may not end up staying in the final project, it will help to get me familiar with using the libraries and packages that I will need to use throughout the project. I am already proficient in TypeScript however I do not have experience with 3D rendering and physics libraries such as ThreeJS and cannon-es.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [x] Set up an environment in Visual Studio Code with support for TypeScript
* [x] Set up the Gtihub repository to store the code in.
* [x] Create a simple Snowpack project.
* [x] Add ThreeJS to the project and render a cube.
* [x] Make the cube spin.
