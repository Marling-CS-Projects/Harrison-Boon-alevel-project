# 1.1 Problem Identification

In the past 1-2 years, during the COVID-19 Pandemics, there have been multiple lockdowns across countries all over the world. While these lockdowns were effective in preventing the spread of Coronavirus, they have caused adverse effects to people's mental health - especially including children [(Kontoangelos, Economou and Papageorgiou, 2020)](../reference-list.md). [von der Heiden et al (2019)](../reference-list.md) suggests that games are used by people with poorer mental health as a means of 'escaping' from the real world and as a way to alleviate stress and other negative mental health symptoms. One of the most common issues that people were using videogames for was to help with boredom. My game will aim to help with this issue.

Another way that videogames are able to reduce negative effects on mental health is via the use of multiplayer capabilities which have been shown to reduce stress in gamers [(Roy and Ferguson, 2016)](../reference-list.md). In the study, stress levels were seen to have decreased when playing multiplayer games, stress levels were seen to have reduced evenly whether the game was co-operative or competitive. And while both game styles were shown to increase overall impression of teammates, competitive was less effective at doing so.

Another problem identified is that, due to the recent chip shortage, technology's cost has skyrocketed up to 30% in some areas of the market [(Knight, 2021)](../reference-list.md). This has led to people not being able to afford the higher-end technology that they used to be able to afford. One effect of this is that people are not able to enjoy games that require a lot of computer resources in order to be run; this has led to a rise in popularity for simpler games that are a a lot easier to run using cheaper, lower-end tech.

One game genre that has been quickly rising in popularity over recent years is Racing Games. This is a genre in which players race cars against their opponents (usually other players) in order to reach an objective as fast as possible. There are many forms that this game can take on such as traditional track racing like in _Gran Turismo 7_ or in more abstract ways such as missions in _Forza Horizon 5_.  Both games are part of two of the best selling racing game franchises [(Goodwood and Jupp, 2021)](../reference-list.md).&#x20;

In order to solve these problems, I will make a game that is a multiplayer racing game. It will have minimalist style as to reduce the amount of resources that would be required to run the game. The multiplayer aspect will help to keep the game interesting and will help to reduce the stress of the user. The puzzles will introduce a way to make the game more in-depth without adding features that could decrease performance or enjoyability.

My game will be free to play and available to download online for both mobile and for PC. This is so that as many people as possible will be able to play the game without having to worry about how much the game costs. I plan to make the multiplayer cross-play so that people will be able to play with their friends without having to have the same system - it could cost extra money if they did not already have compatible systems.
