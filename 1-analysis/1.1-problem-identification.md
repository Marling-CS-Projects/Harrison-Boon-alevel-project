# 1.1 Problem Identification

In the past 1-2 years, during the COVID-19 Pandemics, there have been multiple lockdowns across countries all over the world. While these lockdowns were effective in preventing the spread of Coronavirus, they have caused adverse effects to people's mental health - especially including children [(Kontoangelos, Economou and Papageorgiou, 2020)](../reference-list.md). [(von der Heiden et al., 2019)](../reference-list.md) suggests that games are used by people with poorer mental health as a means of 'escaping' from the real world and as a way to alleviate stress and other negative mental health symptoms. One of the most common issues that people were using videogames for was to help with boredom. My game will aim to help with this issue.

One of the oldest and most popular genres of videogame is the platformer. With the Mario franchise being the 3rd highest grossing video game franchise [(Puckett, 2021)](../reference-list.md), and with one of its earliest platformer games Super Mario Bros. being the 6th best selling video game of all time [(HP, 2021)](../reference-list.md), it is easy to see that platformer games similar to the Mario franchise's have been loved by many different subsections of gamers for a long time. They still remain one of the most popular videogame genres with recent titles such as _Hollow Knight_, C_uphead_ and _Fall_ G_uys_ having been released all within the last 5 years.
