# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Controls

As my game will be available on many different types of devices, it will need to have compatible controls on all of them. I would also like the controls to be simple and easy to understand.

| Device                      | Controls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - |
| Keyboard and Mouse          | A popular control system for movement using a keyboard and mouse is W/A/S/D for throttle, steering left, brake and steering right. The mouse would be used for orbiting the camera and the scroll wheel would be used for zooming the camera in. |   |
| Xbox/PlayStation Controller | Steering left/right would be controlled with the x axis of the left joystick on the controller. Orbiting of the camera will be controlled with the right joystick and throttle/brake will be controlled using the right and the left triggers.   |   |
| Mobile                      | On-screen buttons would control the throttle and the brake. Phones with accelerometers in them will be able to control the steering by tilting the phone left/right.                                                                             |   |
