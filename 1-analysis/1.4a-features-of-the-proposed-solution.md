# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Controls

As my game will be available on many different types of devices, it will need to have compatible controls on all of them. I would also like the controls to be simple and easy to understand.

| Device                                                             | Controls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - |
| Keyboard and Mouse![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)                | A popular control system for movement using a keyboard and mouse is W/A/S/D for throttle, steering left, brake and steering right. The mouse would be used for orbiting the camera and the scroll wheel would be used for zooming the camera in. |   |
| Xbox/PlayStation Controller![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>) | Steering left/right would be controlled with the x axis of the left joystick on the controller. Orbiting of the camera will be controlled with the right joystick and throttle/brake will be controlled using the right and the left triggers.   |   |
| Mobile![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)                      | On-screen buttons would control the throttle and the brake. Phones with accelerometers in them will be able to control the steering by tilting the phone left/right.                                                                             |   |

I think that these controls would be suitable for the majority of popular devices used for gaming. This is because they are simple and easy to understand while also being able to control all the mechanics in my game.

## On-screen information

The game will have simple information displayed around the edge of the screen to supply players with information about their journey and their car. It will include basic information such as speed, position and a map of where they are currently driving. It will look somewhat like the information below.

## GUI

I want my game to have a simple menu interface with a minimal amount of buttons to make sure that it is as easy as possible for users to navigate it. It will need to have a way to navigate between different game modes as welll as a settings page so that players can customise the game to their personal needs.

## Maps

### Main open world map

The main open world map will be randomly generated using Perlin noise to create a simple height map. I might also add randomly distributed features to the map such as trees or rocks. The randomisation will help to keep the player engaged with the game without having to add any new content that would take time to develop and release into the game. The map will also be split into sections with different terrain in each section. This would be areas like a forest, a snowy area or a mountainous region.

### Courses

My game will also include a variety of courses for the player to choose from on the main menu. Most of these will be mainly based around real life racing circuits however I may also make some original levels for people to drive.

## Cars

There will be a selection of cars in the game. Most of the cars will be based off of real life car models. Each of them will have different characteristics that will differentiate them from the rest of the car models in the game. This could include different handling, different speed or different shape and size. The game should have enough different cars so that the replayability of the game is increased.

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
