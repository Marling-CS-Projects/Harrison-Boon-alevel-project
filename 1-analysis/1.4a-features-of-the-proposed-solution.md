# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Controls

As my game will be available on many different types of devices, it will need to have compatible controls on all of them. I would also like the controls to be simple and easy to understand.

| Device                                                             | Controls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - |
| Keyboard and Mouse![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)                | A popular control system for movement using a keyboard and mouse is W/A/S/D for throttle, steering left, brake and steering right. The mouse would be used for orbiting the camera and the scroll wheel would be used for zooming the camera in. |   |
| Xbox/PlayStation Controller![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>) | Steering left/right would be controlled with the x axis of the left joystick on the controller. Orbiting of the camera will be controlled with the right joystick and throttle/brake will be controlled using the right and the left triggers.   |   |
| Mobile![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)                      | On-screen buttons would control the throttle and the brake. Phones with accelerometers in them will be able to control the steering by tilting the phone left/right.                                                                             |   |

I think that these controls would be suitable for the majority of popular devices used for gaming. This is because they are simple and easy to understand while also being able to control all the mechanics in my game.
