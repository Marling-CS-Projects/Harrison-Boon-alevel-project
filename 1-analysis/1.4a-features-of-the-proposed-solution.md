# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Controls

As my game will be available on many different types of devices, it will need to have compatible controls on all of them. I would also like the controls to be simple and easy to understand.

| Device                                                             | Controls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - |
| Keyboard and Mouse![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)                | A popular control system for movement using a keyboard and mouse is W/A/S/D for throttle, steering left, brake and steering right. The mouse would be used for orbiting the camera and the scroll wheel would be used for zooming the camera in. |   |
| Xbox/PlayStation Controller![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>) | Steering left/right would be controlled with the x axis of the left joystick on the controller. Orbiting of the camera will be controlled with the right joystick and throttle/brake will be controlled using the right and the left triggers.   |   |
| Mobile![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)                      | On-screen buttons would control the throttle and the brake. Phones with accelerometers in them will be able to control the steering by tilting the phone left/right.                                                                             |   |

I think that these controls would be suitable for the majority of popular devices used for gaming. This is because they are simple and easy to understand while also being able to control all the mechanics in my game.

## Core Gameplay

My game should be able to run without crashing at a near-constant frame rate of 30 or 60 frames per second - Players will be able to choose whether they would like to run the game at an optimal 60 FPS or whether they would like to conserve their devices resources and play on the less demanding 30 FPS. It will be rendered in 3d using a 3d renderer. Players should be able to save their statistics which includes high scores on circuits, total distance travelled in the main world and total distance travelled in each car alongside other stats that I may add during development. The physics of the car and its interactions with other objects should be somewhat realistic and recognisably similar to the real world. It would be difficult to make the physics extremely close to the real world without requiring a large amount of resources from the device that the player is playing on.

## On-screen information

The game will have simple information displayed around the edge of the screen to supply players with information about their journey and their car. It will include basic information such as speed, position and a map of where they are currently driving. It will look somewhat like the information below.

## GUI

I want my game to have a simple menu interface with a minimal amount of buttons to make sure that it is as easy as possible for users to navigate it. It will need to have a way to navigate between different game modes as welll as a settings page so that players can customise the game to their personal needs.

## Maps

### Main open world map

The main open world map will be procedurally generated using Perlin noise to create a simple height map. I might also add randomly distributed features to the map such as trees or rocks. The randomisation will help to keep the player engaged with the game without having to add any new content that would take time to develop and release into the game. It will also mean that the game can be replayed multiple times with the map being different each time - hopefully this will provoke players to explore each map with their friends to see new ares. The map will also be split into sections with different terrain in each section. This would be areas like a forest, a snowy area or a mountainous region. The map should be large enough so that players can play for a long time without getting bored quickly.

### Courses

My game will also include a variety of courses for the player to choose from on the main menu. Most of these will be mainly based around real life racing circuits however I may also make some original levels for people to drive.

## Cars

There will be a selection of cars in the game. Most of the cars will be based off of real life car models. Each of them will have different characteristics that will differentiate them from the rest of the car models in the game. This could include different handling, different speed or different shape and size. The game should have enough different cars so that the replayability of the game is increased. The cars' graphics will need to be low poly so that it is easy to render them with relatively low resources. The cars will be able to be customised by the player which will change features such as colour and cars. This can keep the game interesting for players and lead to them wanting to continue playing the game for longer. If the map size is too large it will take too many resources to render or will require complex algorithms to progressively generate it.

## Progress

Players will be able to progress through the game through the purchase of upgrades using an in-game currency. The currency will be based off of the total distance that that player has driven in the game. This will encourage the player to drive further distances in the game to unlock upgrades which in turn will make them want to play the game more. The progress will be able to be saved by the player so that they don't have to keep the game open to prevent their progress and upgrades from disappearing.

## Multiplayer

Players should be able to join other player's lobbies. This means that they will be able to play with each other. The hosting player should be able to decide whether they are racing on a circuit together or whether they will explore the open world map together. Players should be able to invite someone they want to play with by sending them a lobby code that corresponds to the lobby that the host player is hosting. This ensures that only people who the host player wants to join can join.

## Accessibility

So that as many people as possible can play my game, I need to make sure that it is accessible to the majority of people. One way of doing this is by making the game available to play in browser, this means that you will be able to play the game if you have a browser regardless of which device you are on or which OS your device is running.

## Limitations

### Multiplayer

When a player hosts a multiplayer lobby, there will be no way to control or manage other players that join the lobby. This means that the hosting player will need to be careful with their invite code to make sure that they do not give it to someone that they do not want in their lobby. There will also be a player limit of 16 players in a lobby so that the servers do not get too full. This will be a limitation as some people may want to play in a group larger than 16 players.

### Performance

As the game is rendered in 3D, it will need quite a modern computer in order to complete all calculations needed for the game at a reasonable speed. The game's performance will also be limited by the browser, multi-core CPUs will only be able to use 1 of their cores per tab that is open in a browser. This issue is especially prevalent if the player has a slower CPU that attempts to make up for that with having multiple cores.

### Gameplay

While the player will have a clear goal and objective when racing on the courses in the game, there will not be as clear of a goal when exploring the open-world aspect to the game. This is because there will be no races in the main world. I hope that the adventuring aspect of the main world will make up for the lack of clear goals and objectives, however this style of gameplay might not suit a lot of players but it is why I have included the courses in the game.
