## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Because the goal of my game is not to create the most accurate driving simulator possible, I will abstract out a lot of the detail necessary when driving in real life. This will also help to make the game as easy to learn as possible for new players and younger children that are new to the game.

* Controls for the car will be simplified and I will ignore some important real life aspects of the car such as gear shifting, headlights and the handbrake. This will mean that players can focus less on the less exciting aspects of driving and can put more of their focus on the fun parts that are important to the racing.
* The car models will be simplified so that less time and fewer resources are used when rendering the game. This can help to reduce the stress on the computer/mobile device that is running the game and will therefore mean that lower spec devices will be able to run the game better than they would have.
* The map will not be fixed and will most likely be generated using Perlin noise or a similar method. This means that I do not have to spend important development time designing a map in a 3d modelling software like Blender. The generated map will also be simpler and easier to render than a designed map and will therefore increase performance of the game.
