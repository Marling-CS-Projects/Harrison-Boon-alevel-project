![PEGI Rating System](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png>)

Pan European Game Information (PEGI) is a video game rating system used in Europe in order for European consumers to make informed decisions about whether or not a game is suitable for them. The system rates games according to recommended minimum age. Games can be given either 3, 7, 12, 16 or 18.

There are 7 factors that can affect the PEGI rating of a game:

* Bad Language
* Discrimination
* Drugs
* Fear
* Gambling
* Sex
* Violence

#### How are games rated:

For physical copies of a game, the publisher is required to fill out a questionnaire detailing the presence of any of the factors that are not deemed appropriate for all ages. After this, the game is given a provisional rating by PEGI based off of their answers. PEGI administrators then review the provisional rating and validate it. After this the game is officially rated and is then allowed to print their game with the appropriate PEGI rating labels. [(PEGI, 2020)](../reference-list.md)

#### How does this relate to my game:

Due to the fact that higher age ratings lead to less people being able to play a game, I find it important to have the lowest age rating possible while keeping the game fun and entertaining for more mature audiences. This means that I will try to not include any of the 7 factors that can affect a game's age rating. In the context of my game, this means trying not to include any unnecessary content in my game that could be classes as any of the criteria above. This will help to ensure that the most people possible will be able to access my game without being excluded by the age limit.

I think that it is extremely likely that my game would be able to reach the criteria needed for it to be rated as a 3 by PEGI or similar rating systems. This is because many similar games to mine have been able to achieve a 3 rating such as Super Mario 64 [(Nintendo, 1996)](../reference-list.md) and 3D Sonic The Hedgehog 2 [(PEGI, 2015)](../reference-list.md).
