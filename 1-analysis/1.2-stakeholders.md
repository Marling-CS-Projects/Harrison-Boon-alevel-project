![PEGI Rating System](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

Pan European Game Information (PEGI) is a video game rating system used in Europe in order for European consumers to make informed decisions about whether or not a game is suitable for them. The system rates games according to recommended minimum age. Games can be given either 3, 7, 12, 16 or 18.

There are 7 factors that can affect the PEGI rating of a game:

* Bad Language
* Discrimination
* Drugs
* Fear
* Gambling
* Sex
* Violence

#### How are games rated:

For physical copies of a game, the publisher is required to fill out a questionnaire detailing the presence of any of the factors that are not deemed appropriate for all ages. After this, the game is given a provisional rating by PEGI based off of their answers. PEGI administrators then review the provisional rating and validate it. After this the game is officially rated and is then allowed to print their game with the appropriate PEGI rating labels. [(PEGI, 2020)](../reference-list.md)

#### What will I do:

Due to the fact that higher age ratings lead to less people being able to play a game, I find it important to have the lowest age rating possible while keeping the game fun and entertaining for more mature audiences. This means that I will try to not include any of the 7 factors that can affect a game's age rating. This could mean that instead of having to fight enemies in my game (this could be counted as violence according to PEGI), I instead would focus the game around non-violent challenges such as intellectual puzzles or platforming.
