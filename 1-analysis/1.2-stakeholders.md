![PEGI Rating System](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

Pan European Game Information (PEGI) is a video game rating system used in Europe in order for European consumers to make informed decisions about whether or not a game is suitable for them. The system rates games according to recommended minimum age. Games can be given either 3, 7, 12, 16 or 18.

There are 7 factors that can affect the PEGI rating of a game:

* Bad Language
* Discrimination
* Drugs
* Fear
* Gambling
* Sex
* Violence

#### How are games rated:

For physical copies of a game, the publisher is required to fill out a questionnaire detailing the presence of any of the factors that are not deemed appropriate for all ages. After this, the game is given a provisional rating by PEGI based off of their answers.
