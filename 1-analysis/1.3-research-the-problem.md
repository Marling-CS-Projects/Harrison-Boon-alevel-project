### Overview

Gran Turismo 7, released in 2022, is a 3d racing game developed by Polyphony Digital for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. There is a wide variety of game modes in Gran Turismo 7 including a singleplayer campaign mode, arcade mode and a multiplayer mode where the player can race other players on various tracks in a variety of cars.

### Controls and Mechanics

Gran Turismo 7 was deigned with the PlayStation controller in mind (<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt="" data-size="line">) and therefore has relatively simple controls. Steering of the car is controlled with the x axis of the left joystick, throttle is applied using the R2 trigger, brake is applied using the L2 trigger and the camera angle is controlled using the right joystick.

### Story

The goal for Super Mario 64 is the same as the goal for most other Mario franchise games. The protagonist, Mario, must save his princess who has been kidnapped by Bowser. As you navigate through different worlds in the game, you chase after Bowser and try to find where he is hiding. In these worlds, Mario encounters various enemies and obstacles that block his path to finding his princess.

| Story Mode              | A story can be used to progress the game naturally and help the user connect with the game.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Open world level design | Levels can be more complex with open world games. This means that the player will have more to do and will keep them engaged for longer.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Enemies                 | Mario faces a wide variety of enemies as he travels through the levels. This adds a sense of goal for the game and also provides a sense of adrenaline for the player.                                                                                                                    |
| Boss battles            | At the end of each group of levels, Mario fights a 'boss' in a 'boss battle'. A boss is an enemy that usually has higher fighting ability than other enemies and is designed to be much harder to beat than other enemies. This works as a good way to end the stage.                     |
| Different camera modes  | Super Mario 64 has two different modes that the camera can be in, switched by a button on the controller. These modes are the 3rd person orbit camera and the 1st person camera. I will include at least both styles in my game so that people can use the camera angle that they prefer. |

Spyro the Dragon has a wide array of controls that includes key features such as running, jumping and gliding. He also has ways to attack his enemies such as breathing fire and his "Charge Attack" where Spyro will charge towards the enemies. All of Spyro's possible movements are controlled with the PlayStation controller (<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">) using various buttons and joysticks. The game's camera is a 3rd person orbit camera that can rotated aroudn Spyro horizontally. The player can also place the camera directly behind Sypro's head which allows the player to look above or below Spyro. Spyro also has an inventory that the player can access by pressing a button. This allows the player to view the collectibles that they have acquired throughout the game.

### Story & World

The player plays as Spyro, a small, purple dragon whose goal it is to free other dragons from crystal prisons that they have been placed in by the main antagonist of the game, Gnasty Gnorc. The crystalised dragons are scattered throughout the world in different levels that Spyro must travel through. The player can access these levels by walking through portals in Spyro's home world. Spyro the Dragon's level design includes large levels with many obstacles, enemies and collectibles. Each level usually has multiple objectives.

| Large level design | Spyro the Dragon's large level design allows for more in-depth and involving stages to be built that can help to further engage the player.                                                                                                                           |   |   |
| Low poly graphics  | The low poly art style is an art style that has slowly been making a return to popularity over the recent years. It is easy to run, requires a non-large amount of resources and can induce a sense of nostalgia in many players.                                     |   |   |
| Flying/Gliding     | Flying and gliding in 3d platforming games is somewhat rare and can create a unique gaming experience for players. It can also expand the possibilities of level design because the game can have levels that would not be possible in the protagonist could not fly. |   |   |

| Complex controls | Spyro has a wide range of controls and combinations of controls. This would not suit my game as it aims to be simple to play.               |   |

## Celeste

![A screenshot from Celeste](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

### Overview

Celeste is a level-based 2d platforming game developed in 2018 by an indie team of developers Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry, collectively known as "Extremely OK Games", based off an earlier game by the same name that was developed in 2016 by the same team of developers for a game jam. The game mechanics are relatively simple and the gameplay is similar to most other 2d platforming games. It is available to play on a multitude of modern gaming sytems including: Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.&#x20;

### Controls & Mechanics

The controls for Celeste are quite simple. As well as movement left to right and jumping, the player can also 'dash' in 8 different directions once in the air. Precise combinations of these controls can cause the player to gain extra speed which they can use to complete levels faster. As the player progresses through levels, they are faced with many enemies and traps which, if killed by, can send the player back to the beginning of the level; often times this causes the player to lose a lot of progress. The game is in 2d and has a camera that is always fixated on the player as they move around in game

### Story\* & World\*

The player controls a young woman, Madeline, on her quest as she climbs Mount Celeste while avoiding a variety of deadly obstacles on her path. Along with the obstacles there are also collectible strawberries that the player can optionally pick up throughout the game if they are looking for a challenge. The world design combined with the art style creates a unique setting for the game.

| Simple graphics            | I enjoy the simple graphics of the game and will include it in my game as well. It means that people can play the game without using many resources.             |   |
| Simple controls            | The simple control scheme of Celeste means that anyone can play the game even without extensive videogame experience.                                            |   |
| Avaialable on many systems | I plan to make my game web-based which would mean that anyone with access to the internet would be able to play my game regardless of what platform they are on. |   |

| 2D art style    | My game will use a 3D art style as it can be more exciting and more immersive for the player and can overall make the gaming experience more exciting. |   |
| Lack of enemies | My game will include enemies in it to allow for more exciting gameplay.                                                                                |   |
| Camera style    | My game will have more options for camera angles than Celeste. A static camera angle would not suit a 3D platforming game.                             |   |
