| Online Multiplayer game mode | Being able to play online with friends is an important aspect to me as it can help the game to be more repeatable without the game starting to feel more repetitive to players.                                                                                                                                   |
| Virtual heads up display     | Gran Turismo has a very detailed virtual heads up display that provides the player with vital information about their car, the circuit that they are driving on and other players around them. It can help newer players to understand the game and also can help veteran players to perfect their playing style. |
| Support for racing wheel     | A racing wheel is a type of videogame controller that simulates a car's steering wheel. Having support for one of these in a game means that people that own a racing wheel and wish to use it in the game can do so effortlessly.                                                                                |
| Different camera modes       | Gran Turismo 7 has many different camera angles that can be accessed while driving the car such as a cockpit camera and a following camera. This means that players can choose whichever setting suits them the best.                                                                                             |

| Only avaialble on one console | Gran Turismo 7 is only available on two consoles, the PlayStation 4 & 5. This ultimately means that gamers who do not own either console will not be able to play the game. In order to make my game available for the most amount of people, I will make it online so that anyone can play it. |
| Real car brands               | Unfortunately, I will not be able to include any real car brands in my game as it may violate copyright laws regarding the car that I am recreating in the game.                                                                                                                                |
| Ultra-realistic graphics      | Including ultra-realistic graphics in my game would mean that anyone without enough resources to support those graphics would not be able to play the game. Having lower graphics also means that I will be able to concentrate more processing power into simulating physics.                  |

## Forza Horizon 5

![A screenshot from Forza Horizon 5](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

### Overview

Forza Horizon 5, released in 2021, is an open-world racing game developed by Turn 10 Studios and published by Xbox Studios. Unlike other racing games it provides an open-world map for players to explore along side more traditional racing missions that follow routes on the map. It has fairly limited multiplayer capabilities with cooperative driving being allowed only inside of missions and races and not while on the open-world map.

### Controls & Mechanics

Forza Horizon 5 was released for the Xbox One and PC which means that there are two different main ways to control the cars, either using an Xbox One controller or keyboard and mouse. Both ways of controlling the car have fairly standard controls with the left joystick on xbox and the A and D keys on keyboard controlling steering and the right/left triggers controlling along with W and S on keyboard controlling the throttle/brakes of the car. The game also ahs support for racing wheels which can help to immerse the player into the experience of driving a car.

### Game Modes

While Forza Horizon 5 does not include any traditional racing circuits, it more than makes up for that with the inclusion of street races that the player can participate in. In street races, the player will aim to drive to a checkpoint or do a certain number of laps of a street circuit faster than the other drivers taking part. These other drivers can be either AIs or other players playing online. Apart from the street races, players can also choose to just explore the in-game map that has many details and fun aspects to it. &#x20;

| Low poly graphics  | The low poly art style is an art style that has slowly been making a return to popularity over the recent years. It is easy to run, requires a non-large amount of resources and can induce a sense of nostalgia in many players.                                     |   |   |
| Flying/Gliding     | Flying and gliding in 3d platforming games is somewhat rare and can create a unique gaming experience for players. It can also expand the possibilities of level design because the game can have levels that would not be possible in the protagonist could not fly. |   |   |

## Mario Kart 8

![A screenshot from Celeste](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

### Overview

Celeste is a level-based 2d platforming game developed in 2018 by an indie team of developers Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry, collectively known as "Extremely OK Games", based off an earlier game by the same name that was developed in 2016 by the same team of developers for a game jam. The game mechanics are relatively simple and the gameplay is similar to most other 2d platforming games. It is available to play on a multitude of modern gaming sytems including: Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.&#x20;

### Controls & Mechanics

The controls for Celeste are quite simple. As well as movement left to right and jumping, the player can also 'dash' in 8 different directions once in the air. Precise combinations of these controls can cause the player to gain extra speed which they can use to complete levels faster. As the player progresses through levels, they are faced with many enemies and traps which, if killed by, can send the player back to the beginning of the level; often times this causes the player to lose a lot of progress. The game is in 2d and has a camera that is always fixated on the player as they move around in game

### Story\* & World\*

The player controls a young woman, Madeline, on her quest as she climbs Mount Celeste while avoiding a variety of deadly obstacles on her path. Along with the obstacles there are also collectible strawberries that the player can optionally pick up throughout the game if they are looking for a challenge. The world design combined with the art style creates a unique setting for the game.
