### Overview

Super Mario 64, released in 1996, is a 3d platforming game developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. The player controls Mario through various courses filled with obstacles, rewards and enemies. Mario must navigate through these worlds in order to save Princess Peach from Bowser's Castle.

### Controls and Mechanics

Super Mario 64 has more controls and features of movement than any of the previous Mario franchise instalments. In the game, Mario can walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, climb, swim, kick, grab objects, and punch all through the use of various joysticks and buttons on the Nintendo 64 controller(<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">). The game is viewed through a 3rd person camera that orbits Mario and moves in accordance to the player's movement inputs but cannot be controlled directly. The game includes a health bar, coin counter and a life counter. The player can also pick up power-ups as they travel which can help Mario to kill enemies and traverse the map faster.

### Story

The goal for Super Mario 64 is the same as the goal for most other Mario franchise games. The protagonist, Mario, must save his princess who has been kidnapped by Bowser. As you navigate through different worlds in the game, you chase after Bowser and try to find where he is hiding. In these worlds, Mario encounters various enemies and obstacles that block his path to finding his princess.

| Story Mode              | A story can be used to progress the game naturally and help the user connect with the game.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Level based progression | Allows for a sense of reward when someone finishes a level which means that they will be incentivised to play the game more.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Enemies                 | Mario faces a wide variety of enemies as he travels through the levels. This adds a sense of goal for the game and also provides a sense of adrenaline for the player.                                                                                                                    |
| Boss battles            | At the end of each group of levels, Mario fights a 'boss' in a 'boss battle'. A boss is an enemy that usually has higher fighting ability than other enemies and is designed to be much harder to beat than other enemies. This works as a good way to end the stage.                     |
| Different camera modes  | Super Mario 64 has two different modes that the camera can be in, switched by a button on the controller. These modes are the 3rd person orbit camera and the 1st person camera. I will include at least both styles in my game so that people can use the camera angle that they prefer. |
