### Overview

Super Mario 64, released in 1996, is a 3d platforming game developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. The player controls Mario through various courses filled with obstacles, rewards and enemies. Mario must navigate through these worlds in order to save Princess Peach from Bowser's Castle.

### Controls and Mechanics

Super Mario 64 has more controls and features of movement than any of the previous Mario franchise instalments. In the game, Mario can walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, climb, swim, kick, grab objects, and punch all through the use of various joysticks and buttons on the Nintendo 64 controller(<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">). The game is viewed through a 3rd person camera that orbits Mario and moves in accordance to the player's movement inputs but cannot be controlled directly. The game includes a health bar, coin counter and a life counter. The player can also pick up power-ups as they travel which can help Mario to kill enemies and traverse the map faster.

### Story

The goal for Super Mario 64 is the same as the goal for most other Mario franchise games. The protagonist, Mario, must save his princess who has been kidnapped by Bowser. As you navigate through different worlds in the game, you chase after Bowser and try to find his location.
