| Online Multiplayer game mode | Being able to play online with friends is an important aspect to me as it can help the game to be more repeatable without the game starting to feel more repetitive to players.                                                                                                                                   |
| Virtual heads up display     | Gran Turismo has a very detailed virtual heads up display that provides the player with vital information about their car, the circuit that they are driving on and other players around them. It can help newer players to understand the game and also can help veteran players to perfect their playing style. |
| Support for racing wheel     | A racing wheel is a type of videogame controller that simulates a car's steering wheel. Having support for one of these in a game means that people that own a racing wheel and wish to use it in the game can do so effortlessly.                                                                                |
| Different camera modes       | Gran Turismo 7 has many different camera angles that can be accessed while driving the car such as a cockpit camera and a following camera. This means that players can choose whichever setting suits them the best.                                                                                             |

| Large level design | Spyro the Dragon's large level design allows for more in-depth and involving stages to be built that can help to further engage the player.                                                                                                                           |   |   |
| Low poly graphics  | The low poly art style is an art style that has slowly been making a return to popularity over the recent years. It is easy to run, requires a non-large amount of resources and can induce a sense of nostalgia in many players.                                     |   |   |
| Flying/Gliding     | Flying and gliding in 3d platforming games is somewhat rare and can create a unique gaming experience for players. It can also expand the possibilities of level design because the game can have levels that would not be possible in the protagonist could not fly. |   |   |

| Complex controls | Spyro has a wide range of controls and combinations of controls. This would not suit my game as it aims to be simple to play.               |   |

## Celeste

![A screenshot from Celeste](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

### Overview

Celeste is a level-based 2d platforming game developed in 2018 by an indie team of developers Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry, collectively known as "Extremely OK Games", based off an earlier game by the same name that was developed in 2016 by the same team of developers for a game jam. The game mechanics are relatively simple and the gameplay is similar to most other 2d platforming games. It is available to play on a multitude of modern gaming sytems including: Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.&#x20;

### Controls & Mechanics

The controls for Celeste are quite simple. As well as movement left to right and jumping, the player can also 'dash' in 8 different directions once in the air. Precise combinations of these controls can cause the player to gain extra speed which they can use to complete levels faster. As the player progresses through levels, they are faced with many enemies and traps which, if killed by, can send the player back to the beginning of the level; often times this causes the player to lose a lot of progress. The game is in 2d and has a camera that is always fixated on the player as they move around in game

### Story\* & World\*

The player controls a young woman, Madeline, on her quest as she climbs Mount Celeste while avoiding a variety of deadly obstacles on her path. Along with the obstacles there are also collectible strawberries that the player can optionally pick up throughout the game if they are looking for a challenge. The world design combined with the art style creates a unique setting for the game.

| Simple graphics            | I enjoy the simple graphics of the game and will include it in my game as well. It means that people can play the game without using many resources.             |   |
| Simple controls            | The simple control scheme of Celeste means that anyone can play the game even without extensive videogame experience.                                            |   |
| Avaialable on many systems | I plan to make my game web-based which would mean that anyone with access to the internet would be able to play my game regardless of what platform they are on. |   |

| 2D art style    | My game will use a 3D art style as it can be more exciting and more immersive for the player and can overall make the gaming experience more exciting. |   |
| Lack of enemies | My game will include enemies in it to allow for more exciting gameplay.                                                                                |   |
| Camera style    | My game will have more options for camera angles than Celeste. A static camera angle would not suit a 3D platforming game.                             |   |
