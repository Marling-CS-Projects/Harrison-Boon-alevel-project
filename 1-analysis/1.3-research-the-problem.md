| Online Multiplayer game mode | Being able to play online with friends is an important aspect to me as it can help the game to be more repeatable without the game starting to feel more repetitive to players.                                                                                                                                   |
| Virtual heads up display     | Gran Turismo has a very detailed virtual heads up display that provides the player with vital information about their car, the circuit that they are driving on and other players around them. It can help newer players to understand the game and also can help veteran players to perfect their playing style. |
| Support for racing wheel     | A racing wheel is a type of videogame controller that simulates a car's steering wheel. Having support for one of these in a game means that people that own a racing wheel and wish to use it in the game can do so effortlessly.                                                                                |
| Different camera modes       | Gran Turismo 7 has many different camera angles that can be accessed while driving the car such as a cockpit camera and a following camera. This means that players can choose whichever setting suits them the best.                                                                                             |

| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Only avaialble on one console | Gran Turismo 7 is only available on two consoles, the PlayStation 4 & 5. This ultimately means that gamers who do not own either console will not be able to play the game. In order to make my game available for the most amount of people, I will make it online so that anyone can play it. |
| Micro transactions            | I want my game to be enjoyable without requiring players to spend money on the game. This is why I am making my game absolutely free for anyone to play, without any micro-transactions or additional purposes.                                                                                 |
| Ultra-realistic graphics      | Including ultra-realistic graphics in my game would mean that anyone without enough resources to support those graphics would not be able to play the game. Having lower graphics also means that I will be able to concentrate more processing power into simulating physics.                  |

## Forza Horizon 5

![A screenshot from Forza Horizon 5](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png>)

### Overview

Forza Horizon 5, released in 2021, is an open-world racing game developed by Turn 10 Studios and published by Xbox Studios. Unlike other racing games it provides an open-world map for players to explore along side more traditional racing missions that follow routes on the map. It has fairly limited multiplayer capabilities with cooperative driving being allowed only inside of missions and races and not while on the open-world map.

### Controls & Mechanics

Forza Horizon 5 was released for the Xbox One and PC which means that there are two different main ways to control the cars, either using an Xbox One controller or keyboard and mouse. Both ways of controlling the car have fairly standard controls with the left joystick on xbox and the A and D keys on keyboard controlling steering and the right/left triggers controlling along with W and S on keyboard controlling the throttle/brakes of the car. The game also ahs support for racing wheels which can help to immerse the player into the experience of driving a car.

### Game Modes

While Forza Horizon 5 does not include any traditional racing circuits, it more than makes up for that with the inclusion of street races that the player can participate in. In street races, the player will aim to drive to a checkpoint or do a certain number of laps of a street circuit faster than the other drivers taking part. These other drivers can be either AIs or other players playing online. Apart from the street races, players can also choose to just explore the in-game map that has many details and fun aspects to it. &#x20;

| Large level design | Forza Horizon's map is very large and detailed which provides a constant source of new content for both new and experienced players alike.                                                                                                                                      |   |   |
| Controls           | Since the controls in Forza Horizon 5 are standard and are similar to that of the most popualr racing games, it would make sense for me to use the same control scheme for my game so that players that have played these other games before do not have to learn new controls. |   |   |
| Weather            | Forza Horizon 5 has dynamic weather which can affect how the car handles and how difficult it is to control the car. This can help the game to be more realistic.                                                                                                               |   |   |

| Limits on multiplayer    | As mentioned, multiplayer is only available when racing in missions or street circuits. I want my game to be able to have multiplayer everywhere.                                                                             |   |
| Ultra-realistic graphics | Ultra-realistic graphics would make my game hard to run on devices that do not have high-end specifications such as the Xbox One or most PC gaming setups. This would mean a lot of people would not be able to play my game. |   |
| Real car brands          | Unfortunately, I will not be able to include any real car brands in my game as it may violate copyright laws regarding the car that I am recreating in the game.                                                              |   |

### Overview

Mario Kart 8, released in 2014, is a 3d caroon racing game developed by Nintendo and relased for the Wii U. It is a simple arcade racing game in which players can select a charater from any of the Mario franchise games and can choose a car to compete in. They can then race against either AI or other players online in order to cross the line first after 3 laps of any of the Mario-themed race courses in the game.

### Controls & Mechanics

The game is intended to be controlled by the Wii U controller. Steering is controlled with the left joystick, acceleration is controlled with the A button on the gamepad and power-ups can be used with the left trigger on the gamepad. Power-ups are an important part of Mario Kart 8, players can drive over 'Mystery boxes' in the game which will give them either a special item or special ability that will give them an advantage in the race. Examples of power ups are: a red shell which can be thrown at opponents in order to slow them down and a star which can be consumed and makes the driver faster and invincible for a short period of time.

### Game Modes

In the game, the player can either face the AI in the game or they can battle head-to-head with other players via the internet. There are also 4 different difficulty modes 50cc, 100cc, 150cc and 200cc. These serve to give the player a choice of whether they want a harder game or an easier, more relaxed game.

| Multiplayer content     | The multiplayer mode in Mario Kart 8 is vastly more popular than the single-player game mode. This is because it is fun to play with friends.                                                               |   |
| Simple controls         | The simple control scheme of Mario Kart 8 means that anyone can play the game even without extensive video-gaming experience.                                                                               |   |
| Circuit content variety | I plan to include many circuits in my game alongside the open world content. In order to make sure that this does not become boring for players, I aim to add as much variety as possible to each circuit.  |   |

| Lack of open-world content | Mario Kart 8 is played exclusively on the circuits that are provided with the game. There is no open-world map where players can drive around without an objective or without racing.                                            |   |
| Power-ups                  | My game will not include power-ups. My game is aiming to have realistic physics and power-ups would not lead to that.                                                                                                            |   |
| Camera style               | There is only 1 camera angle in Mario Kart 8 which cannot be controlled by the player and can sometimes be annoying to players. I want multiple camera angle options so that the player can choose the one they prefer the most. |   |
