| 1        | The game should be able to consistently run for long periods of time without crashing.  | Crashing of a game can completely ruing the gaming experience for a player and can cause inconveniences such as having to regain lost progress.                                                   | [Core Gameplay](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#core-gameplay) |
| 2        | The game should run at a frame rate of either 30 or 60 FPS (chosen by player).          | Low FPS can cause games to slow down and make the experience irritable for the player.                                                                                                            | [Core Gameplay](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#core-gameplay) |
| 3        | The player should be relaxed and get some sort of enjoyment out of the game experience. | As is mentioned in 1.1, video games have been proven to reduce negative effects on mental health. I need to make sure that my game can also do this sufficiently.                                 | [Problem Identification](1.1-problem-identification.md)                  |
| 4        | The game should not include any age-restricted content.                                 | In order to keep the PEGI rating of my game low which would maximise the number of possible players, I need to make sure that there is not any content that would raise the age limit of my game. | [PEGI Rating](1.2-stakeholders.md#pegi-rating)                           |
| 5        | The game should be accessible to everyone.                                              | In order to maximise the number of potential players, I will need to make sure that as many people as possible can play my game and have access to it.                                            | [Accessibility](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#accessibility) |

| 7        | There should be at least 3 different car models with different characteristics available to drive in the game. | A variety of car models and characteristics allows for multiple style of driving and will keep the game interesting for players.

| 8        | Cars should be able to be customised by the player.                                                            | Customisation features ensure that players are able to replay the same game over and over without getting bored of the same content.                                                                                  | [Cars](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#cars) |

| 9        | The main world map should be procedurally generated.    | This means that each map is different and you can replay the game multiple times with new areas to explore.                                  | [Main Open World Map](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#main-open-world-map) |
| 10       | The main world map should be colourful                  | Having a colourful texture will ensure that the procedurally generated map does not seem repetitive and boring.                              | [Main Open World Map](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#main-open-world-map) |
| 11       | Maps should have an appropriate size.                   | Having too small of a size could cause boredom for players, too large a size could cause performance issues.                                 | [Main Open World Map](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#main-open-world-map) |
| 12       | Players will also be able to drive on courses.          | It provides a different game mode for the player to have fun in.                                                                             | [Courses](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#courses)                         |
| 13       | A variety of courses should be available to the player. | Including a wide variety of courses will mean that the player will be able to play the game for longer without getting bored of the content. | [Courses](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#courses)                         |
| 14       | The map should load in in chunks.                       | Loading the map in chunks will reduce the load on the device and will lead to less resources being needed.                                   | [Main Open World Map](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#main-open-world-map) |
