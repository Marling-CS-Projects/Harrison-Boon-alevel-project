| 1        | The game should be able to consistently run for long periods of time without crashing.  | Crashing of a game can completely ruing the gaming experience for a player and can cause inconveniences such as having to regain lost progress.                                                   | [Core Gameplay](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#core-gameplay) |
| 2        | The game should run at a frame rate of either 30 or 60 FPS (chosen by player).          | Low FPS can cause games to slow down and make the experience irritable for the player.                                                                                                            | [Core Gameplay](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#core-gameplay) |
| 3        | The player should be relaxed and get some sort of enjoyment out of the game experience. | As is mentioned in 1.1, video games have been proven to reduce negative effects on mental health. I need to make sure that my game can also do this sufficiently.                                 | [Problem Identification](1.1-problem-identification.md)                  |
| 4        | The game should not include any age-restricted content.                                 | In order to keep the PEGI rating of my game low which would maximise the number of possible players, I need to make sure that there is not any content that would raise the age limit of my game. | [PEGI Rating](1.2-stakeholders.md#pegi-rating)                           |
| 5        | The game should be accessible to everyone.                                              | In order to maximise the number of potential players, I will need to make sure that as many people as possible can play my game and have access to it.                                            | [Accessibility](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#accessibility) |

| 6        | Cars should have basic, low-poly graphics.                                                                     | If the cars did not have basic graphics, it would take more resources to render them and therefore be less accessible to people with graphically lower-end devices.                                                   | [Cars](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#cars) |
| 7        | There should be at least 8 different car models with different characteristics available to drive in the game. | A variety of car models and characteristics allows for multiple style of driving and will keep the game interesting for players. Having many options will mean that the player can pick whichever they like the most. | [Cars](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#cars) |
| 8        | Cars should be able to be customised by the player.                                                            | Customisation features ensure that players are able to replay the same game over and over without getting bored of the same content.                                                                                  | [Cars](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#cars) |
| 9        | Players can purchase upgrades to the car using an in-game currency                                             | This will entice players to play the game more so that they can unlock new parts that will improve their driving experience                                                                                           | [Cars](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#cars) |
