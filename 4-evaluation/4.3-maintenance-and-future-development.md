# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* **Multiplayer support** - There is no way to play the game with/against other people, which limits replayability and overall enjoyability.
* **Control mapping** - There is no way to re-assign controls in the game, this limits the player as they can not set certain controls to whatever they would prefer.
* **Realtime map generation** - There is only one piece of terrain in the main map, and when you reach then end, no more generated.
* **Graphics** - Currently, the graphics are very low poly and aren't complex or realistic at all.
* **Settings** - There aren't settings that the player can acces in the game, this limits the player to only being able to ply with the hard-coded settings.

## Maintenance

I have separate strategies for future maintenance depending on whether or not I decide to expand the project in the future, adding more features. I will compare each approach accordingly and assess which would be the most sensible course of action to take.

#### Current size

With the current amount of features in the game and given the overall complexity of the codebase, it should be relatively easy to maintain. Any current semi-serious bugs would be fixed, however I wouldn't address any of the [#current-limitations-of-project](4.3-maintenance-and-future-development.md#current-limitations-of-project "mention"). I would do further testing on the project to ensure that it was ready for a stable release.
