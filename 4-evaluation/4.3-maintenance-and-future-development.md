# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* **Multiplayer support** - There is no way to play the game with/against other people, which limits replayability and overall enjoyability.
* **Control mapping** - There is no way to re-assign controls in the game, this limits the player as they can not set certain controls to whatever they would prefer.
* **Realtime map generation** - There is only one piece of terrain in the main map, and when you reach then end, no more generated.
* **Graphics** - Currently, the graphics are very low poly and aren't complex or realistic at all.
* **Settings** - There aren't settings that the player can acces in the game, this limits the player to only being able to ply with the hard-coded settings.
