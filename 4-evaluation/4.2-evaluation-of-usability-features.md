# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                       | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | Game shouldn't induce stress / should be relaxing | Partial Success |
| 2           | The game should be enjoyable to play              | Success         |

### Feature 1

While there weren't many aspects of the game that were specifically designed to reduce stress, the results of [#question-1](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-1 "mention")were generally positive. Overall, however, the results were still quite mixed, and I feel as if I could have done more related to this feature. Therefore, in future development, I definitely plan to add more to the game to ensure this feature is fully completed.&#x20;

### Feature 2

As shown in[#question-2](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-2 "mention"), all testers of my game found it to be enjoyable. I tried to make sure that whenever I added something new to the game or changed a feature, there would be no way that it would irritate the player or cause the game to lose some enjoyability. To continue development in this area, I would add more game modes to ensure that players do not get bored.&#x20;

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                     | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Menu navigation is simple and easy to use       | Success      |
| 2           | Controls are simple / easy to learn / intuitive | Success      |

### Feature 1

The main menu in my game is very simple with only two buttons on the first screen, they are both clearly labeled. They are both responsive, meaning that when you press them, you get immediate feedback which shows the player that they have pressed that button. If I add more buttons to the menu in the future, I will need to make sure that they are also as simple to use as the current ones.

### Feature 2

Due to the game's simple nature, the controls are suitably also easy to understand. There is also a button on the game's main menu that shows the player the control scheme so the player can learn them before playing. In [#question-4](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-4 "mention"), respondents were overwhelmingly in agreement that the controls were intuitive and easy to learn

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description                        | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | Game is able to be replayed        | Partial Success |
| 2           | Graphics are interesting / complex | Fail            |
| 3           | Player has a clear goal            | Success         |

### Feature 1

While the procedurally generated random terrain does allow for a different map to be loaded each time the player plays the game, the objective will always be the same. Therefore, I believe this is a partial success, with some aspects being more repetitive and non-changing than others.

### Feature 2

Because of possible performance issues and also due to time constraints on my project, I was not able to fulfill this feature, with neither the map, the checkpoints nor the vehicle chassis having a particularly detailed 3d appearance.

### Feature 3

The game doesn't include many distractions and therefore the objective should hopefully be obvious. This is backed up by positive feedback on [#question-8](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-8 "mention")which shows that players were able to easily find the goal of the game.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                                 | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The FPS should be consistently above 60     | Success      |
| 2           | Crashing should not occur                   | Success      |
| 3           | There should be no bugs that break the game | Success      |

### Feature 1

Throughout multiple testing phases of my game - including ones specifically designed to test FPS with extra checkpoints, larger terrain, etc. - the FPS stayed constantly above 60. This is mirrored by the questionnaire's results for [#question-7](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-7 "mention"), in which no players reported performance under 60FPS.

### Feature 2

Barring early stages of the project, in which I was still setting up the development environment, my game has never once crashed during the development process. This is backed up by the fact that during the process of getting other people to test my game, none of them experienced any crashing either.

### Feature 3

Serious bugs that can break the game are a massive issue that I was trying to avoid as they need to be fixed which can, in some cases, take quite a long time. Thankfully, there were very few bugs encountered in the game were only minor ([#question-6](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-6 "mention")).

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                                           | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Should be easy to work out the goal of the game       | Success      |
| 2           | Controls should be simple / easy to learn / intuitive | Success      |

### Feature 1

There aren't many distractions from the main objective in the game, which leads to the goal of the game being hopefully quite clear. This is shown in the results of [#question-8](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-8 "mention")of the questionnaire, to which respondents answered exclusively that the goal was either "easy" or "very easy" to understand.

### Feature 2

Due to the game's simple nature, the controls are suitably also easy to understand. There is also a button on the game's main menu that shows the player the control scheme so the player can learn them before playing. In [#question-4](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-4 "mention"), respondents were overwhelmingly in agreement that the controls were intuitive and easy to learn
