# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                       | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | Game shouldn't induce stress / should be relaxing | Partial Success |
| 2           | The game should be enjoyable to play              | Success         |

### Feature 1

While there weren't many aspects of the game that were specifically designed to reduce stress, the results of [#question-1](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-1 "mention")were generally positive. Overall, however, the results were still quite mixed, and I feel as if I could have done more related to this feature. Therefore, in future development, I definitely plan to add more to the game to ensure this feature is fully completed.&#x20;

### Feature 2

As shown in[#question-2](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-2 "mention"), all testers of my game found it to be enjoyable. I tried to make sure that whenever I added something new to the game or changed a feature, there would be no way that it would irritate the player or cause the game to lose some enjoyability. To continue development in this area, I would add more game modes to ensure that players do not get bored.&#x20;
