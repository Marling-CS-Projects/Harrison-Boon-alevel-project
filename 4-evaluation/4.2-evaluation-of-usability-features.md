# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                       | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | Game shouldn't induce stress / should be relaxing | Partial Success |
| 2           | The game should be enjoyable to play              | Success         |

### Feature 1

While there weren't many aspects of the game that were specifically designed to reduce stress, the results of [#question-1](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-1 "mention")were generally positive. Overall, however, the results were still quite mixed, and I feel as if I could have done more related to this feature. Therefore, in future development, I definitely plan to add more to the game to ensure this feature is fully completed.&#x20;

### Feature 2

As shown in[#question-2](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-2 "mention"), all testers of my game found it to be enjoyable. I tried to make sure that whenever I added something new to the game or changed a feature, there would be no way that it would irritate the player or cause the game to lose some enjoyability. To continue development in this area, I would add more game modes to ensure that players do not get bored.&#x20;

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                     | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Menu navigation is simple and easy to use       | Success      |
| 2           | Controls are simple / easy to learn / intuitive | Success      |

### Feature 1

The main menu in my game is very simple with only two buttons on the first screen, they are both clearly labeled. They are both responsive, meaning that when you press them, you get immediate feedback which shows the player that they have pressed that button. If I add more buttons to the menu in the future, I will need to make sure that they are also as simple to use as the current ones.

### Feature 2

Due to the game's simple nature, the controls are suitably also easy to understand. There is also a button on the game's main menu that shows the player the control scheme so the player can learn them before playing. In [#question-4](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-4 "mention"), respondents were overwhelmingly in agreement that the controls were intuitive and easy to learn
