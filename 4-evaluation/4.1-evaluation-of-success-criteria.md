# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Non-functional

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                          | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1         | Game should be able to run without crashing          | All cycles           |
| 2         | Game should be able to run consistently at 60 FPS    | Cycle 4              |
| 3         | The player should feel relaxed when playing the game | All cycles           |
| 4         | The game should not include age restricted content   | All cycles           |
| 5         | The game should be accessible to everyone            | All cycles           |

### Criteria 1 & 2

Video of my game, not crashing
{% endembed %}

I tried stress-testing my game by pressing/spamming random buttons in order to see if it would crash under extreme circumstances. However, my game successfully did not crash.

In the same test, I recorded the FPS of the game, which never appeared to dip under 60 FPS. This was alongside other tests in which I had rendered more unnecessary content.&#x20;

### Criterion 3

Despite the question not having been overwhelmingly positively answered, more than half of respondents answered that they at least somewhat agreed that the game can relieve stress.

### Criterion 4



### Criterion 5



## Vehicles

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                    | When was it achieved |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 6         | Cars should have basic, low-poly graphics.                                                                     | Cycle 5              |
| 7         | There should be at least 3 different car models with different characteristics available to drive in the game. | Was not achieved     |
| 8         | Cars should be able to be customised by the player.                                                            | Was not achieved     |

### Criterion 6

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Low-poly car model</p></figcaption></figure>

I decided that the performance was more important than the appearance of the game and focused on a very low-poly design for the car, with very blocky wheels attached to just a box as the body of the car. If there had been much more detail then the performance, specifically that of the collision detection, would have taken a big hit. The vehicle and its model were implemented in[2.2.5-cycle-5-adding-a-vehicle.md](../design-and-development/2.2.5-cycle-5-adding-a-vehicle.md "mention").

### Criterion 7

This ended up not being implemented due to time constraints and the fact that I thought it was not particularly necessary for the game.

### Criterion 8

Similarly, I felt that this would not add much to the game compared to how much work it would take to add it to the game.

## Maps

| Criterion | Description                                          | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 9         | The main world map should be procedurally generated. | Cycle 3              |
| 10        | The world map should be colourful                    | Cycle 3              |
| 11        | Maps should have an appropriate size                 | Cycle 3              |
| 12        | Players will also be able to drive on courses        | Was not achieved     |
| 13        | A variety of courses should be available             | Was not achieved     |
| 14        | The main world should have checkpoints               | Cycle 7 & 8          |
