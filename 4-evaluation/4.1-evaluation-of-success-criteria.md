Video of my game, not crashing
{% endembed %}

I tried stress-testing my game by pressing/spamming random buttons in order to see if it would crash under extreme circumstances. However, my game successfully did not crash.

In the same test, I recorded the FPS of the game, which never appeared to dip under 60 FPS. This was alongside other tests in which I had rendered more unnecessary content.&#x20;

### Criterion 3

Despite the question not having been overwhelmingly positively answered, more than half of respondents answered that they at least somewhat agreed that the game can relieve stress.
