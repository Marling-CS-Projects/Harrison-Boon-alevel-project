# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Non-functional

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                          | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1         | Game should be able to run without crashing          | All cycles           |
| 2         | Game should be able to run consistently at 60 FPS    | Cycle 4              |
| 3         | The player should feel relaxed when playing the game | All cycles           |
| 4         | The game should not include age restricted content   | All cycles           |
| 5         | The game should be accessible to everyone            | All cycles           |

### Criteria 1 & 2

Video of my game, not crashing
{% endembed %}

I tried stress-testing my game by pressing/spamming random buttons in order to see if it would crash under extreme circumstances. However, my game successfully did not crash.

In the same test, I recorded the FPS of the game, which never appeared to dip under 60 FPS. This was alongside other tests in which I had rendered more unnecessary content.&#x20;

### Criterion 3

Despite the question not having been overwhelmingly positively answered, more than half of respondents answered that they at least somewhat agreed that the game can relieve stress.

### Criterion 4



### Criterion 5



## Vehicles

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                    | When was it achieved |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 6         | Cars should have basic, low-poly graphics.                                                                     | Cycle 5              |
| 7         | There should be at least 3 different car models with different characteristics available to drive in the game. | Was not achieved     |
| 8         | Cars should be able to be customised by the player.                                                            | Was not achieved     |

### Criterion 6

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Low-poly car model</p></figcaption></figure>

I decided that the performance was more important than the appearance of the game and focused on a very low-poly design for the car, with very blocky wheels attached to just a box as the body of the car. If there had been much more detail then the performance, specifically that of the collision detection, would have taken a big hit. The vehicle and its model were implemented in[2.2.5-cycle-5-adding-a-vehicle.md](../design-and-development/2.2.5-cycle-5-adding-a-vehicle.md "mention").

### Criterion 7

This ended up not being implemented due to time constraints and the fact that I thought it was not particularly necessary for the game.

### Criterion 8

Similarly, I felt that this would not add much to the game compared to how much work it would take to add it to the game.

## Maps

| Criterion | Description                                          | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 9         | The main world map should be procedurally generated. | Cycle 3              |
| 10        | The world map should be colourful                    | Cycle 3              |
| 11        | Maps should have an appropriate size                 | Cycle 3              |
| 12        | Players will also be able to drive on courses        | Was not achieved     |
| 13        | A variety of courses should be available             | Was not achieved     |
| 14        | The main world should have checkpoints               | Cycle 7 & 8          |

### Criterion 9

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Procedurally generated terrain</p></figcaption></figure>

Despite changes to generation variables and parameters leading to a change over several cycles to the appearance of the in-game terrain, the main procedural generation algorithm was built and introduced in [2.2.3-cycle-3-terrain-generation.md](../design-and-development/2.2.3-cycle-3-terrain-generation.md "mention"). Later improvements to the algorithm and its generation came in [2.2.4-cycle-4-misc.-fixes.md](../design-and-development/2.2.4-cycle-4-misc.-fixes.md "mention").

### Criterion 10

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Colourful terrain</p></figcaption></figure>

This feature was added to the game in [2.2.3-cycle-3-terrain-generation.md](../design-and-development/2.2.3-cycle-3-terrain-generation.md "mention"), and later adaptions/adjustments were added in subsequent cycles.

### Criterion 11

The map was added in cycle 3 and the map's size was also decided in the same cycle. I picked the size to be the right size. If the map was too small then the game would be less enjoyable, however, if the map size had been too large, the game's performance would have been affected.

### Criterion 12

This feature was not implemented because I thought that developing courses for the game would waste a large amount of time. This is because I would have to model a 3d environment in an app like Sketchup or Blender. I would also then have to model the collisions for the environment in Cannon-ES.

### Criterion 13

Was not achieved because no courses were implemented.

### Criterion 14

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Checkpoints on the map</p></figcaption></figure>

Checkpoints on the main map came into the game near the end of the development process. First with [2.2.7-cycle-7-adding-objectives.md](../design-and-development/2.2.7-cycle-7-adding-objectives.md "mention"), which dealt with the rendering and placement of the checkpoints, and secondly with [2.2.8-cycle-8-adding-a-finish-to-the-game.md](../design-and-development/2.2.8-cycle-8-adding-a-finish-to-the-game.md "mention") that added the functionality behind the checkpoints: detecting collisions, ending the game, etc.

| 23        | There should be on-screen information about the vehicle | Was not achieved     |
| 24        | There should be a main menu                             | Cycle 6              |
| 25        | Main menu should be easy to navigate                    | Cycle 6              |

### Criterion 18

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/yG6F6aOPLC8" %}
Car being controlled
{% endembed %}

The feature of vehicle control was added at the same time as the vehicle itself ([2.2.5-cycle-5-adding-a-vehicle.md](../design-and-development/2.2.5-cycle-5-adding-a-vehicle.md "mention")). I tried to make the controls as common as possible so that people wouldn't have to learn different keybinds than what they might be used to.

### Criterion 19

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Implementing the physics collisions was one of the first things I did after working out rendering in 3d. They were added in [2.2.2-cycle-2.md](../design-and-development/2.2.2-cycle-2.md "mention"). I would use the same physics engine used in that cycle throughout my project.
